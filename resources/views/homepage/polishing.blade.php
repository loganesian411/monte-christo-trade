@section('machine_description')
<p>Small areas of metal can quickly and easily be polished and buffed using wooden polishing tools and polishing compounds. Barrel polishers consist of a rotating drum with a steel shot of different shames, and a soap and compounds that aid in polishing and erosion.  They are used to polish multiple pieces at a time. The polished steel shot is harder than other metals, so as the barrel rotates the steel burnishes the pieces within. Fragile work should not be barrel polished, and neither should pieces containing gemstones. Chains, however, should only be polished in a barrel and never on a motor as it can easily get tangled up. Motorized polishers (pictured) use a spindle to achieve optimum results. Tripoli compound is used first, as it is slightly abrasive and will polish out fine scratches on the surface of the metal. The item being polished needs to be consistently moved by the polisher to prevent the item from getting too hot. Over-polishing can wear away edges, corners, and details.</p>
